  the logic to aggregate the organizational hierarchy of configs.

  right now.. tenants specify their org (bad) 
  soon.. job hierarchy = org hierarchy: 
  
  first folder in the hierarchy will have their pipeline_configuration
  repository loaded as a library implicitly

  folder structure within that library reflect the same hierarchy so 
  config files can be found.

  a better way might be to add a property to the Folder class in Jenkins
  to put the config files right on the folders themselves.

  TBD
