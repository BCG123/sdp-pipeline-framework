/*
    We do a lot of executing the code inside files and we're also
    dependent on the binding being preserved (as it stores step impls).

    The default CpsGroovyShell leveraged in CpsScript's evaluate method
    is insufficient for our needs because it instantiates each shell with
    a new Binding() instead of using getBinding().

    Of course, there's no setContext() method on GroovyShell or 
    CpsGroovyShell to override the binding used in the constructor, 
    so we've gotta use reflection to override it directly.
